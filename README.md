# Version 0.0
Our new game, still in development.

Hello! Welcome to the game!

We are Alluranubis, and we are working on a project called: TRASH WARS.

It will be a game where trash characters can fight with each other. On the game you can choose your character, your bat (ex.baseball bat), emotes and etc!

In the first version we will put on the shop, unique items that will only be avaliable on this version, and NOT MORE. So don't miss that up! The game is free, and will be avaliable on the link on the folder called: "LINK"

# Characters

The characters can be: trashes, cats, dogs, or even monsters! The characters sometimes will have styles, that are classified by its rarity: COMMON, RARE, EPIC, LEGENDARY

Every character will have its own rarity, the characters released on the first version, are considered the rarest. So get them now folks!

We put an exclusive photo of the rarest character in the folder "IMAGES"

# Emotes

The emotes are an feature that allows you to dance, and make fun of your oponent! We like to make it ragey, but funny too!

Some emotes can be awarded by doing missions and things, but some emotes, you gotta buy...

# Events

We have an idea to make live events, just like Fortnite, to make our game good and fun!

Also we will have special events, (ex. Halloween Event 50% off!)

# Final notes

Just saying again, that our game isn't out yet, we create this repositoey to have help, and good ideas for our game!

We don't have a date for release :'-(
